## About The Project
This is a simple ToDo List project using Laravel and Vue.js, 
where you can add, edit, delete and mark as done the tasks.

## key considerations
- I did not create two separate projects for the frontend and backend (Api), Instead the frontend is integrated into the Laravel project. 
You can find the frontend setup in the **resources/js** folder and **welcome.blade.php**.
